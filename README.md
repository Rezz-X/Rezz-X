### About Me

I'm a fourth year Cognitive Science Major with a specialization in Machine Learning and Neurocomputation at the University of California, San Diego. I plan on specializing in data visualization/analyzation, data wrangling, data cleanup, and machine learning algorithm optimization. Beyond university, I'm pursuing work in data science, software engineering/development, data analysis, and machine learning engineering. 


### Languages

I work primarily with Python but have some experience with C++, R, Java, HTML, CSS, Javascript, and Git.
